# Magic Eraser

A simple add-on that discards the lowest-value item in your bags -- including completed quest items, vendor-quality white items, low-level consumables, and gray-quality "trash" items -- when you click the mini-map button.

## How It Works

⚠️ **Magic Eraser** acts decisively -- there is no "Are you sure?" step. 

* Everything erased comes from a manually curated, multiple-human-reviewed, approved trash list.
* From there, Magic Eraser scans all items in your bags and identifies the lowest-value item to erase.
* It looks at the following:
  * Completed Quest Items and "Provided For" Items that linger in your bag indefinitely.
  * Generic consumable items with a use level at least 10 levels lower than your character.
  * Vendor-quality white items, from an approved list.
  * Gray vendor items.
